!!! The files contained in this directory should be used only
on the mac platform !!!

The mac version of Audacity is linked statically, and Aurora, to
avoid external libraries dipendences, uses the embedded wxWidgets
symbols. But! Not all wxWidgets class are used in the Audacity code,
so only some symbols has been embedded.

This directory contanins the wxWidgets code that is used by Aurora and
it hasn't been embedded in Audacity.
